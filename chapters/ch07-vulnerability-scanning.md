# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 7 â€“ Vulnerability Scanning  

Notes and study guide from *Getting Started Becoming a Master Hacker* by **OccupyTheWeb**.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Vulnerability Scanning?  
- Process of identifying **known weaknesses** in systems, applications, and networks.  
- Typically uses **automated tools** to compare findings against vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD).  
- Goal: build a list of exploitable entry points.  
- Important step **after recon, before exploitation**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Types of Vulnerability Scanning  

### 2.1 Network Scanning  
- Focus: open ports, services, misconfigurations.  
- Detects: outdated protocols (FTP, Telnet), weak SSL/TLS.  

### 2.2 Web Application Scanning  
- Looks for flaws in websites/apps.  
- Common vulnerabilities:  
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)  
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
  - File inclusion vulnerabilities (LFI/RFI)  

### 2.3 Host-Based Scanning  
- Examines OS and installed software.  
- Identifies:  
  - Missing patches  
  - Weak configurations  
  - Default passwords  

### 2.4 Wireless Scanning  
- Identifies Wi-Fi security issues.  
- Weak encryption (WEP), misconfigured access points, rogue devices.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Popular Vulnerability Scanners  

- **Nessus** â†’ one of the most popular, broad coverage.  
- **OpenVAS** â†’ open-source Nessus alternative.  
- **Nikto** â†’ web server scanner, finds dangerous files & misconfigs.  
- **sqlmap** â†’ automated SQL injection tool.  
- **OWASP ZAP** â†’ web app scanner, great for developers & testers.  
- **Burp Suite** â†’ manual + automated web vulnerability testing.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Workflow for Vulnerability Scanning  
1. **Define scope** â†’ identify which systems to scan.  
2. **Run scans** using appropriate tools.  
3. **Validate results** â†’ eliminate false positives.  
4. **Prioritize vulnerabilities** (based on severity & exploitability).  
5. **Document findings** for later exploitation or reporting.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Interpreting Results  
- Scanners rate findings:  
  - **Critical** â†’ exploitable immediately, high risk.  
  - **High** â†’ severe misconfigurations or outdated software.  
  - **Medium** â†’ moderate issues, may require chaining.  
  - **Low/Info** â†’ unlikely to be exploitable alone.  
- Remember: **not all findings are real vulnerabilities** â†’ manual verification needed.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Risks of Vulnerability Scanning  
- Can disrupt fragile systems (DoS).  
- May trigger **IDS/IPS alerts**.  
- Can generate **false positives or false negatives**.  
- Must always scan within **legal scope**.  

---

## âœ… Key Takeaways  
- Vulnerability scanning = **bridge between recon and exploitation**.  
- Covers network, web apps, hosts, and wireless.  
- Essential tools: **Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto, sqlmap, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite**.  
- Always verify scanner results manually before exploitation.
