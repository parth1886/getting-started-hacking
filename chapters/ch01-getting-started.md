## 🔹 1. Introduction  
- Hacking = **critical skill of the 21st century**.  
- Once a hobby → now a **global profession**:
  - Governments  
  - Espionage agencies  
  - Militaries  
  - Security firms  
  - Cybercriminals  
- This chapter focuses on:  
  1. Professions for hackers  
  2. History of hacking  
  3. Legal consequences

## 🔹 2. Professions for Hackers  

### 2.1 National Security  
- Nations employ hackers for both defense & offense.  
- Focus on **SCADA/ICS systems** (power, water, petroleum).  
- Example: Russia disabling Ukraine’s power grid.  

### 2.2 Espionage  
- Digital espionage cheaper & safer than human agents.  
- Hackers increasingly replace traditional spies.  

### 2.3 Military  
- Modern battlefield = highly digital.  
- Hackers disrupt comms, logistics, and enemy weapons.  
- Example: U.S. Army’s first **field hacker unit** (Ft. Campbell).  

### 2.4 Pentesting (Penetration Testing)  
- Companies hire hackers to test defenses legally.  
- Goal: hack them before criminals do.  
- Deliverable: **security report + remediation plan**.  

### 2.5 Bug Bounty Hunting  
- Rewards for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities.  
- Some payouts: **$1M+**.  
- Example: Santiago Lopez → first hacker to earn $1M.  

### 2.6 Zero-Day Developers  
- **Zero-day** = unknown, unpatched vulnerability.  
- Extremely valuable → sold to governments, crime groups.  
- Example: **EternalBlue** (NSA exploit → WannaCry, NotPetya).  

### 2.7 InfoSec Engineers  
- Best defenders = hackers who know offense.  
- Analogy: generals & coaches must know opponent strategies.

## 🔹 3. Black Hat vs White Hat  
- Traditional:  
  - White Hat = ethical  
  - Black Hat = malicious  
- Modern reality: **blurred lines**.  
  - U.S. hackers = heroes at home, criminals abroad.  
  - Russian hackers = same story in reverse.  
- Author’s stance: outdated terms, uses “white hat” broadly.

## 🔹 4. History of Hacking  

### Famous Hackers  
- **Steve Jobs & Wozniak** → “Blue Box” (free phone calls, 1972).  
- **Julian Assange** → hacked DoD/NASA, later founded WikiLeaks.  
- **Kevin Poulsen** → rigged radio contest, later journalist.  
- **Mudge (Peiter Zatko)** → cDc member, BackOrifice, DARPA advisor.  

### Key Events  
- 1986 – Markus Hess hacks nuclear lab, sells to USSR.  
- 1988 – **Morris Worm** → first Internet worm (25% outage).  
- 1999 – **Melissa Virus** → MS Word macro spreads worldwide.  
- 2001 – **Elcomsoft case** → password cracking + DMCA.  
- 2003 – **Anonymous formed**.  
- 2007 – **TJX breach** → 45M credit cards stolen.  
- 2009 – **Conficker Worm** → MS08-067 exploit → botnet.  
- 2010 – **Stuxnet** → U.S./Israel sabotage of Iran centrifuges.  
- 2011 – **Sony PSN hack** (77M accounts).  
- 2013 – **Target/Home Depot hacks** (100M credit cards).  
- 2013 – **Yahoo breach** (3B accounts).  
- 2016 – **U.S. election hacks** (Russian GRU).  
- 2017 – **EternalBlue leak** (NSA exploit).  
- 2017 – **WannaCry & NotPetya ransomware** → billions in damages.  
- 2018 – **Marriott/Starwood breach** (500M records).  

👉 **Lesson:** Hacking shapes **politics, economy, and warfare**.

## 🔹 5. Legal Consequences  

### Enforcement  
- **Secret Service** → coordinating lead agency.  
- **FBI Cyber Task Force** → main investigative body.  
- Local task forces → smaller cases (< $100K damages).  

### U.S. Laws  
1. **USC Title 18 §1029** → Access Device fraud (early phone hacks).  
2. **USC Title 18 §1030 (CFAA)** → illegal to access “protected computers.”  
   - Even scanning systems → potential felony.  
3. **DMCA (1998)** → bans bypassing copyright protections.  
4. **Cyber Security Enhancement Act (2002)** →  
   - Life sentence if cyberattack causes death/injury.  
   - Expanded surveillance powers.  

### ⚠️ Final Warning  
- Intent doesn’t always matter legally.  
- Having hacking tools = may be considered criminal intent.  
- **Hack safe → only in labs/VMs you control.**

## ✅ Chapter 1 Summary  
- Hacking = **global profession** with careers in pentesting, bug bounty, zero-days, military, espionage.  
- Hackers have shaped history (worms, ransomware, elections, cyberwar).  
- Laws are broad and unforgiving → even “curiosity” can be criminalized.  
- Practice safely in **controlled labs** only.
